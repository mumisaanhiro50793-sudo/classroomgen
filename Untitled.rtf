\f0\fs24 \cf0 I totally like the idea of a classroom gallery, where students can share their generated image and their prompts. However, it\
\uc0\u9612  does feel unnatural that other classmates can refine my image and use up my edits. So let's modify the logic here. 1. students\
\uc0\u9612  log in with their own credentials and only the same user can apply edits to their own generated image. 2. design a 'share'\
\uc0\u9612  button, only when students click this button the image will be displayed in the classroom gallery. however, all images\
\uc0\u9612  generated should appear in teacher dashboard for monitoring purposes. 3. on teachers panel, add a function to generate random\
\uc0\u9612  combinations of username and password for n students, where n can be decided by teacher. These combinations should be formatted\
\uc0\u9612  nicely in a table, easy to export and print, so that teachers can give them to individual students. The random user name and\
\uc0\u9612  password should be both 8 characters, to save some time for the students. Please work on these updates.}
